Sendyo is a logistics app connecting parcel senders with travelers who can deliver items along their journey in exchange for extra income. I led the development of the mobile app using Flutter, implementing real-time communication, clean modular architecture, and role-based logic. I also set up Firebase configurations and streamlined builds with Codemagic.
